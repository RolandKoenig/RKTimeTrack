# Title
Decisions should have a proper name. For example, “ADR 42: Strategy-Pattern for multiple checking algorithms” or “ADR 9: Keycloak for secrets management”

## Context
Describe the situation, including technical, political, social, and project aspects. These forces might be in tension.

## Decision
What is our decision (reply to the forces described in the context)

## Status
A decision may be “proposed” if the important stakeholders haven’t agreed with it yet, or “accepted” once it is agreed. It could also be “deprecated” or “superseded”, hopefully with a reference to its replacement.

## Consequences
What will or can happen as consequences of this decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the “positive” ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future.
